# Attendance-Visualisation
My Dissertation Project on *Attendance Monitoring Visualisation*, at the University of Sussex (2023).

## Motivations
As university attendance rates continue to soar, the number of staff checking up on student attendance has stayed roughly the same. Sussex experiences this just as much as other universities, and as such, there is space/need for more powerful tool to visualise and filter attendance data.

### **(WIP!)**
Note: must have a valid python virtual environment `/venv` and config file `config.yaml` in the `/api` directory, and `/node_modules` in the main `/Attendance-Visualisation`

Start React Application (Frontend): `npm start`

Start Flask API (Backend): `npm run-script start-api`
